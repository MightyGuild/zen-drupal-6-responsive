  ; "core" specifies the version of Drupal that this theme is compatible with.
  ; "base theme" specifies that this is a theme that uses the "zen" theme as its
  ; base theme. Its unlikely you will ever need to change these, but they are
  ; required fields for a Zen sub-theme. The "engine" field is not used in a
  ; sub-theme since the engine is inherited from its base theme.

; This section controls the CSS files for your theme. There are 3 different
; things you can do with a "stylesheets" line:
; - Add a new stylesheet for your theme.
; - Override a module's stylesheet. If the stylesheet you are adding uses the
;   same filename as a stylesheet from a Drupal core or contrib module, your CSS
;   file will be used instead of the module's file.
; - Remove a module's stylesheet. If you specify the name of a Drupal core or
;   contrib module's stylesheets, Drupal will remove that stylesheet if you do
;   NOT include a file with that name with your theme.
;
; stylesheets[MEDIA][] = FILE
;
; The "FILE" is the name of the stylesheet to add/override/remove.
; The "MEDIA" in the first set of brackets is a media type or a media query.
; Typical CSS media types include "all", "screen", "print", and "handheld". A
; typical media query is "screen and (max-width: 320px)".
;
; CSS2.1 media types: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/media.html#media-types
; CSS3 media queries: http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/

; First we remove the system's menu and message styling since Zen has its own.
stylesheets[all][] = system.menus.css
stylesheets[all][] = system.messages.css
stylesheets[all][] = system.theme.css

; Then we add our own stylesheet.
stylesheets[all][] = css/styles.css

; Built-in conditional stylesheet support has been removed from Zen 7.x-5.x.
; Instead, Zen now adds conditional-comment-included classes to the html
; element, such as .lt-ie9, .lt-ie8, .lt-ie7. More information on this
; technique can be found at:
; http://paulirish.com/2008/conditional-stylesheets-vs-css-hacks-answer-neither/
;
; If you still wish to use conditional stylesheets, you must install the
; conditional stylesheets module: http://drupal.org/project/conditional_styles
;stylesheets-conditional[lte IE 8][all][] = css/ie8.css

  ; Optionally add some JavaScripts to your theme.

  ; The regions defined in Zen's default page.tpl.php file.  The name in
  ; brackets is the name of the variable in the page.tpl.php file, (e.g.
  ; "[content_top]" in the .info file means there should be a $content_top
  ; variable in the page.tpl.php file.) The text after the equals sign is a
  ; descriptive text used on the admin/build/blocks page.
  ;
  ; To add a new region, copy Zen's page.tpl.php to your sub-theme's directory,
  ; add a line line to this file, and then add the new variable to your
  ; page.tpl.php template.

  ; Various page elements output by the theme can be toggled on and off. The
  ; "features" control which of these check boxes display on the
  ; admin/build/themes config page. This is useful for suppressing check boxes
  ; for elements not used by your sub-theme. To suppress a check box, omit the
  ; entry for it below. See the Drupal 6 Theme Guide for more info:
